DATA STRUCTURE
Mode to store data in different ways in an organised manner.
Advantages:
->Efficiency
->Easy to handle
->Processing
->Consistency
Disadvantage:
->Limited flexiblity(different type of data/change data)
->Cost


ALGORITHM
A set of instructions or steps required to solve a computational problem.
->problem solving skills
->efficiency in understanding the problem and bring out a optimised solution.


TYPES OF DATA STRUCTURE:
1.Primitive : simple, single value in memory location, eg: int,float,boolean etc
2.Non primitive: complex, pointers to memeory location, derived from primitive DS.
->divided into linear(arrays,list,ll,stacks,queues,tuples) and non linear(tree,graph,set,dictionary).


TYPES OF ALGORITHMS:
->sorting
->searching
->graph
->recursive
->divide and conquer
->dynamic programming
